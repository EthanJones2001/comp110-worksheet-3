# COMP110 Worksheet 3: Flowcharts and pseudocode

This is the base repository for COMP110 Worksheet 3.

Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
Begin

found_correct_word = false
chosen_word = first word chosen
likeness = how many correct letters

while found_correct_word == false:

	if chosen_word != hidden word:
   	    
		if amount of likeness in chosen_word == 0:
			find all words that have same letters as in chosen_word and remove
      else:
         find all words that have less letters that match chosen_word and remove
	
	else:
	    //finished game
		found_correct_word = true
		End		
```
